# My dotfiles for linux

This repository contains my configuration dotfiles for linux (mostly archlinux). Sensitive parts of the config have been encrypted using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) (Note to self: use git-crypt unlock after you clone this repository). 

This is not updated often as I am currently using a macbook and I have a separate dotfile repository for my config files in macos ([this](https://github.com/AbstractGeek/my-dotfiles-macos) one).
